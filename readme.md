This is a simple react component to simulate a 2d cyclical cellular
automaton.

This was written for my blog at
[wildsilicon.com](http://wildsilicon.com).  I'm not sure it has any
real use other than that.  To see it in action, visit the [blog
entry](http://wildsilicon.com/blog/2018/demon).  There is a live
version of the component there, along with a description of what it
does.
